# class_prop_mplus

This project just creates a function that calculates the appropriate parameters for
an MPlus .inp file to set the class proportions for a MCMC simulation study.

## Files

class_prop_mplus.r is the script creates the function.
class_prop_mplus.rmd is the markdown document that describes the function.

## Installation

No installer just yet. I'll make this a small package eventually.

## Usage

```r
# returns 'mplus_code'
class_prop_mplus('classes', 'proportions')
```
